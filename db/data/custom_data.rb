    description: 'Material not tied to any one specific genre, material about roleplaying in general, or accessories that are not intrinsically linked to a specific genre (dice, miniatures, reference books, etc.).

  scifi: {

  horror: {
    title: 'Horror',
    description: 'Material set in an environment of palpable, spine-tingling, skin-crawling fear. Someone may be out to get you, or your darkest secrets may be about to be revealed. Do you crack under the pressure or let the wrong thing slip to the wrong person? Hope for escape might seem slight. A crazy axe murderer might be after you. A spooky haunted castle may be the main backdrop. A monster might be on the loose or a serial killer might be stalking and killing people, one by one...'
