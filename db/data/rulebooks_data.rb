    genre: 'Fantasy',
    description: "The streets of Duskvol are haunted. By vengeful ghosts and cruel demons. By the masked spirit wardens and their lightning-hooks. By sharp-eyed inspectors and their gossiping crows. By the alluring hawkers of vice and pleasure. By thieves and killers and scoundrels like you — the Blades in the Dark.\n\nThe noble elite grow ever richer from the profits of their leviathan-hunting fleets and electroplasm refineries. The Bluecoats of the constabulary crack skulls and line their pockets with graft. The powerful crime syndicates leech coin from every business, brothel, drug den, and gambling house. And then there's your crew of scoundrels: all the way down at the bottom rung. Can you make it to the top? What are you willing to do to get there? There's only one way to find out...\n\nBlades in the Dark is a tabletop role-playing game about a gang of criminals seeking their fortunes on the haunted streets of Duskvol. There are heists, chases, occult mysteries, dangerous bargains, bloody skirmishes, and, above all, riches to be had if you're bold enough.\n\nYou play to find out if your fledgling crew can thrive amidst the threats of rival gangs, powerful noble families, malicious ghosts, the Bluecoats of the city watch, and the siren song of your scoundrel’s own vices.",

    genre: 'Post Apocalypse',
    description: "Nobody remembers how or why. Maybe nobody ever knew. The oldest living survivors have childhood memories of it: cities burning, society in chaos then collapse, families set to panicked flight, the weird nights when the smoldering sky made midnight into a blood-colored half-day.\n\nNow the world is not what it was. Look around you: evidently, certainly, not what it was. But also close your eyes, open your brain: something is wrong. At the limits of perception, something howling, everpresent, full of hate and terror. From this, the world's psychic maelstrom, we none of us have shelter.",

These glimpses into the supernatural can cause us to retreat into comforting lies — “There are no such things as monsters” — or stir our morbid curiosity. Only a few, however, can overcome their fear and dare to look deeper.\n\nThe Chronicles of Darkness (sometimes “CofD”), the renamed second edition of The World of Darkness, was released in 2015 with the release of the Chronicles of Darkess Rulebook, featuring a game of ordinary people who find themselves embroiled in the supernatural.",

It has no fixed setting, traits, or genre and is almost entirely customizable. However, it is designed to offer the least possible obstruction to role-playing by assuming that players do not want to make large amounts of dice rolls. Fate was written by Fred Hicks and Rob Donoghue. As Evil Hat considers Fate Accelerated to be a variant of Fate Core and not a separate RPG, this entry follows that convention and includes all items associated with Fate Accelerated.',
